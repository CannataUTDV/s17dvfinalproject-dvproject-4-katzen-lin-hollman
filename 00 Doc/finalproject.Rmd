#**Introduction**
This is our Final Project R-markdown document. Our group explored data from two public government databases. 
The first is titled "US Census population estimates, Income (American Community Survey, 2011-2015)". The dataset includes population estimates of Income categorized and subcategorized into groups according to age, race, and educational background.

and was sourced from the US Census Bureau datasets archived in data.world. 

The second is "DIR Cooperative Contract Sales Data â€“ Fiscal 2010 to Present", which was sourced through the TX government database website (https://data.texas.gov/Business-and-Economy/DIR-Cooperative-Contract-Sales-Data-Fiscal-2010-to/w4x7-gfja/data). 

#**Extract-Translate-Load (ETL)**
In order to extract the pertinent data from our raw CSVs, we generated a number of R-scripts that tidied current data and excised nonrelevant data that were not used in our Tableau and ShinyApp visualizations. Our cleaned-up (post-ETL) versions were then uploaded to the data.world servers, available for downloading and querying.
Data manipulations will be shown for only one ACS CSV file, but similar methods were used for the remaining three files.

## 1. Raw (Pre-ETL) CSVs:
As you can see below, the raw csv contains data across more variables than were necessary for this project. 
```{r getpre}
library(knitr)
source("../01 Data/getpreINC.R")
kable(preINC, digits = 0)
```

## 2. ETL script to distill data:
Plyr and dplyr functions were used to filter out the pertinent information. Separate scripts were used for each file. 
```{r getetl}
source("../01 Data/etlINC.r", echo=TRUE, print.eval=FALSE, verbose=FALSE, keep.source=TRUE)
```
## 3. Finished (Post-ETL) CSV file:
Workable CSVs contain only national data grouped by state (excl. DC and Puerto Rico) and pertaining to population demographic delineations of age, sex, race, income, and employment.
The finished CSV documents were much smaller in size, and better enabled us to investigate trends and correlations between datasets.
```{r getpost}
library(knitr)
source("../01 Data/getpostINC.R")
kable(postINC, digits = 0)
```
